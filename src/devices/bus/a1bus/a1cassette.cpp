/*****************************************************************************
**  Cassette interface I/O
**
**  The Apple I's cassette interface was a small card that plugged
**  into the expansion connector on the motherboard.  (This was a
**  slot-type connector, separate from the motherboard's edge
**  connector, but with the same signals.)  The cassette interface
**  provided separate cassette input and output jacks, some very
**  simple interface hardware, and 256 bytes of ROM containing the
**  cassette I/O code.
**
**  The interface was mostly software-controlled.  The only hardware
**  was an output flip-flop for generating the cassette output signal,
**  a National Semiconductor LM311 voltage comparator for generating a
**  digital signal from the analog cassette input, an input
**  signal-level LED, and some gates to control the interface logic
**  and address decoding.  The cassette ROM code did most of the work
**  of generating and interpreting tape signals.  It also contained
**  its own mini-monitor for issuing tape read and write commands.
**
**  The cassette interface was assigned to the $C000-$CFFF block of
**  addresses, although it did not use most of the space in that
**  block.  Addresses were mapped as follows:
**
**      $C000-$C0FF:  Cassette I/O space.
**                    Any access here toggles the output signal.
**          $C000-$C07F:  Cassette output only; input disabled.
**                        Mirrors $C100-$C17F on reads.
**          $C080-$C0FF:  Cassette input and output.
**                        When input low, mirrors $C180-$C1FF on reads.
**                        When input high, both odd and even addresses
**                        mirror even ROM addresses $C180-$C1FE.
**      $C100-$C1FF:  Cassette ROM code.
**
**  Note the peculiar addressing scheme.  Data was written simply
**  through repeated accesses, rather than by writing to an address.
**  Data was read by reading an odd input address and comparing the
**  ROM byte returned to detect signal changes.
**
**  The standard tape signal was a simple square wave, although this
**  was often greatly distorted by the cassette recorder.  A single
**  tape record consisted of a 10-second 800-Hz leader, followed by a
**  single short square-wave cycle used as a sync bit, followed by the
**  tape data.  The data was encoded using a single square-wave cycle
**  for each bit; "1" bits were at 1000 Hz, "0" bits at 2000 Hz.  (All
**  of these frequencies are approximate and could vary due to
**  differences in recorder speed.)  Each byte was written starting
**  from the most significant bit; bytes were written from low to high
**  addresses.  No error detection was provided.  Multiple records
**  could be placed on a single tape.
