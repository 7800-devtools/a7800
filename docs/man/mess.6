.\"
.\" *******************************************************
.SS Output Directory Options
.\" *******************************************************
.TP
.B \-cfg_directory \fIpathname
Specifies a single directory where configuration files are stored.
Configuration files store user configurable settings that are read at
startup and written when MESS exits. The default is 'cfg' (that is,
a directory 'cfg' in the same directory as the MESS executable). If this
directory does not exist, it will be automatically created.
.TP
.B \-nvram_directory \fIpathname
Specifies a single directory where NVRAM files are stored. NVRAM files
store the contents of EEPROM and non\-volatile RAM (NVRAM) for systems
which used this type of hardware. This data is read at startup and
written when MESS exits. The default is 'nvram' (that is, a
directory 'nvram' in the same directory as the MESS executable). If this
directory does not exist, it will be automatically created.

state files are read and written either upon user request, or when using
the \-autosave option. The default is 'sta' (that is, a directory 'sta'
in the same directory as the MESS executable). If this directory does
not exist, it will be automatically created.
.TP
.B \-snapshot_directory \fIpathname
Specifies a single directory where screen snapshots are stored, when
requested by the user. The default is 'snap' (that is, a directory 'snap'
in the same directory as the MESS executable). If this directory
does not exist, it will be automatically created.
.TP
.B \-diff_directory \fIpathname
Specifies a single directory where hard drive differencing files are
stored. Hard drive differencing files store any data that is written
back to a hard disk image, in order to preserve the original image. The
differencing files are created at startup when a system with a hard disk
image. The default is 'diff' (that is, a directory 'diff' in the same
directory as the MESS executable). If this directory does not exist,
it will be automatically created.
.TP
.B \-comment_directory \fIpathname

.\" *******************************************************
.SS State/playback options
.\" *******************************************************
.TP
.B \-state \fIslot
Immediately after starting the specified system, will cause the save
state in the specified slot to be loaded.
.TP
.B \-[no]autosave
When enabled, automatically creates a save state file when exiting MESS
and automatically attempts to reload it when later starting MESS with
the same system. This only works for systems that have explicitly enabled
save state support in their driver. The default is OFF (\-noautosave).
.TP
.B \-playback, \-pb \fIfilename
Specifies a file from which to play back a series of system inputs. This
feature does not work reliably for all systems, but can be used to watch
a previously recorded system session from start to finish. In order to
make things consistent, you should only record and playback with all
configuration (.cfg), NVRAM (.nv), and memory card files deleted. The
default is NULL (no playback).
.TP
.B \-[no]exit_after_playback
If play back is enabled (see \-playback option) the program exits when
end of file is reached. Otherwise the machine will continue to run.
Default is OFF (\-noexit_after_playback).
.TP
.B \-record, \-rec \fIfilename
Specifies a file to record all input from a system session. This can be
used to record a system session for later playback. This feature does not
work reliably for all systems, but can be used to watch a previously
recorded system session from start to finish. In order to make things
consistent, you should only record and playback with all configuration
(.cfg), NVRAM (.nv), and memory card files deleted. The default is NULL
(no recording).
.TP
.B \-[no]record_timecode
Specify whether to create a timecode file. It contains a line with elapsed
times on each press of timecode shortcut key (default is F12).
This option works only when recording mode is enabled (\-record option).
The file is saved on inp folder.
Default is OFF (\-norecord_timecode).
.TP
.B \-mngwrite \fIfilename
Writes each video frame to the given file in MNG format, producing
an animation of the system session.
Note that \-mngwrite only writes video frames; it does not save any audio
data. Use \-wavwrite for that, and reassemble the audio/video using
offline tools. The default is NULL (no recording).
.TP
.B \-aviwrite \fIfilename
Stream video and sound data to the given file
in AVI format, producing an animation of the system session complete
with sound. The default is NULL (no recording).
.TP
.B \-wavwrite \fIfilename
Writes the final mixer output to the given file
in WAV format, producing an audio recording of the system session.
The default is NULL (no recording).
.TP
.B \-snapname \fIstring
Describes how MESS should name files for snapshots. \fIstring\fP
provides a template that is used to generate a filename. Three
simple substitutions are provided: the / character represents the
path separator on any target platform (even Windows); the literal \fB%g\fP
represents the driver name of the current system; and the literal \fB%i\fP
represents an incrementing index. If \fB%i\fP is omitted, then each
snapshot taken will overwrite the previous one; otherwise, MESS will
find the next empty value for \fB%i\fP and use that for a filename. The
default is '%g/%i', which creates a separate folder for each game,
and names the snapshots under it starting with 0000 and increasing
from there. In addition to the above, for drivers using different
media, like carts or floppy disks, you can also use the
\fB%d\fP\fI_[media]\fP indicator. Replace \fI[media]\fP with the media
switch you want to use. A few examples: if you use
.B mess nes \-cart robby \-snapname %g/%d_cart
snapshots will be saved as \fBsnaps/nes/robby.png\fP; if you use
.B mess c64 \-flop1 robby \-snapname %g/%d_flop1/%i
snapshots will be saved as \fBsnaps/c64/robby/0000.png\fP.
.TP
.B \-snapsize \fIwidth\fRx\fIheight
Hard\-codes the size for snapshots and movie recording. By default,
MESS will create snapshots at the system's current resolution in raw
pixels, and will create movies at the system's starting resolution in
raw pixels. If you specify this option, then MESS will create both
snapshots and movies at the size specified, and will bilinear filter
the result. Note that this size does not automatically rotate if the
system is vertically oriented. The default is 'auto'.
.TP
.B \-snapview internal\fR|\fBauto\fR|\fIviewname
Specifies the view to use when rendering snapshots and movies. By
default, both use a special 'internal' view, which renders a separate
snapshot per screen or renders movies only of the first screen. By
specifying this option, you can override this default behavior and
select a single view that will apply to all snapshots and movies.
Note that \fIviewname\fP does not need to be a perfect match; rather, it
will select the first view whose name matches all the characters
specified by \fIviewname\fP. For example, \-snapview native will match the
"Native (15:14)" view even though it is not a perfect match.
\fIviewname\fP can also be 'auto', which selects the first view with all
screens present. The default value is 'internal'.
.TP
.B \-[no]snapbilinear
Specify whether snapshot/movie should have bilinear filtering applied.
Default is ON (\-snapbilinear).
.TP
.B \-statename \fIstring
Describes how MESS should store save state files, relative to the
state_directory path. \fIstring\fP provides a template that
is used to generate a relative path. Two simple substitutions are
provided: the / character represents the path separator on any target
platform (even Windows); the literal \fB%g\fP represents the driver name of
the current game. The default is '%g', which creates a separate folder
for each game. In addition to the above, for drivers using different
media, like carts or floppy disks, you can also use the
\fB%d_\fP\fI[media]\fP indicator. Replace \fI[media]\fP with the media
switch you want to use. A few examples: if you use
.B mess nes \-cart robby \-statename %g/%d_cart
save states will be stored inside \fBsta/nes/robby/\fP; if you use
.B mess c64 \-flop1 robby \-statename %g/%d_flop1
save states will be stored inside \fBsta/c64/robby/\fP.
.TP
.B \-[no]burnin
Tracks brightness of the screen during play and at the end of
emulation generates a PNG that can be used to simulate burn\-in
effects on other systems. The resulting PNG is created such that the
least\-used areas of the screen are fully white (since burned\-in areas
are darker, all other areas of the screen must be lightened a touch).
The intention is that this PNG can be loaded via an artwork file with
a low alpha (e.g, 0.1\-0.2 seems to work well) and blended over the
entire screen. The PNG files are saved in the snap directory under
the system/burnin\-<screen.name>.png. The default is OFF (\-noburnin).

.TP
.B \-[no]autoframeskip, \-[no]afs
Automatically determines the frameskip level while you're playing the
system, adjusting it constantly in a frantic attempt to keep the system
running at full speed. Turning this on overrides the value you have set
for \-frameskip below. The default is OFF (\-noautoframeskip).
.TP
.B \-frameskip, \-fs \fIvalue
Specifies the frameskip value (autoframeskip must be disabled). This is the
number of frames out of every 12 to drop when running. For example, if you
say \-frameskip 2, then MESS will display 10 out of every 12 frames. By
skipping those frames, you may be able to get full speed in a system that
requires more horsepower than your computer has. The default value is 0,
which skips no frames.
.TP
.B \-seconds_to_run, \-str \fIvalue
This option can be used for benchmarking and automated testing. It tells
MESS to stop execution after a fixed number of seconds. By combining
this with a fixed set of other command line options, you can set up a
consistent environment for benchmarking MESS performance. In addition,
upon exit, the \-str option will write a screenshot called final.png
to the system's snapshot directory.
.TP
.B \-[no]throttle
Configures the default thottling setting. When throttling is on, MESS
attempts to keep the system running at the system's intended speed. When
throttling is off, MESS runs the system as fast as it can. Note that the
fastest speed is more often than not limited by your graphics card,
especially for older systems. The default is ON (\-throttle).
.TP
.B \-[no]sleep
Allows MESS to give time back to the system when running with \-throttle.
This allows other programs to have some CPU time, assuming that the
system isn't taxing 100% of your CPU resources. This option can potentially
cause hiccups in performance if other demanding programs are running.
The default is ON (\-sleep).
.TP
.B \-speed \fIvalue
Controls the speed of gameplay, relative to realtime; smaller numbers are
slower. Default is 1.00.
.TP
.B \-[no]refreshspeed, \-[no]rs
Automatically adjusts the \-speed parameter to keep the effective refresh
rate below that of the lowest screen refresh rate.
Default is OFF (\-norefreshspeed).

.SS Rotation options
.\" *******************************************************
.TP
.B \-[no]rotate
Rotate the system to match its normal state (horizontal/vertical). This
ensures that both vertically and horizontally oriented systems show up
correctly without the need to rotate your monitor. If you want to keep
the system displaying 'raw' on the screen the way the actual machine would
have, turn this option off. The default is ON (\-rotate).
.TP
.B \-[no]ror \-[no]rol
Rotate the system screen to the right (clockwise) or left
(counter\-clockwise) relative to either its normal state (if \-rotate
is specified) or its native state (if \-norotate is specified).
Default for both is OFF (\-noror \-norol).
.TP
.B \-[no]autoror \-[no]autorol
These options are designed for use with pivoting screens that only
pivot in a single direction. If your screen only pivots clockwise,
use \-autorol to ensure that the system will fill the screen either
horizontally or vertically in one of the directions you can handle.
If your screen only pivots counter\-clockwise, use \-autoror.
Default for both is OFF (\-noautoror \-noautorol).
.TP
.B \-[no]flipx \-[no]flipy
Flip (mirror) the system screen either horizontally (\-flipx) or
vertically (\-flipy). The flips are applied after the \-rotate and

.TP
.B \-brightness \fIvalue
Controls the default brightness, or black level, of the system screens.
This option does not affect the artwork or other parts of the display.
Using the MESS UI, you can individually set the brightness for each system
screen; this option controls the initial value for all visible system
screens. The standard value is 1.0. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1)
will produce a darkened display, while selecting higher values (up to
2.0) will give a brighter display. The default is 1.0.
.TP
.B \-contrast \fIvalue
Controls the contrast, or white level, of the system screens. This option
does not affect the artwork or other parts of the display. Using the
MESS UI, you can individually set the contrast for each system screen;
this option controls the initial value for all visible system screens. The
standard value is 1.0. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1) will produce
a dimmer display, while selecting higher values (up to 2.0) will
give a more saturated display. The default is 1.0.
.TP
.B \-gamma \fIvalue
Controls the gamma, which produces a potentially nonlinear black to
white ramp, for the system screens. This option does not affect the
artwork or other parts of the display. Using the MESS UI, you can
individually set the gamma for each system screen; this option controls
the initial value for all visible system screens. The standard value is
1.0, which gives a linear ramp from black to white. Selecting lower

.B \-video\fR [\fIsoft\fR|\fIopengl\fR|\fInone\fR]
Specifies which video subsystem to use for drawing:
.br
\fBsoft\fR  uses software rendering, which is slower but more compatible.
.br
\fBopengl\fR  uses OpenGL and your graphics accelerator to speed up many
aspects of drawing MESS including compositing artwork, overlays, and
bezels, as well as stretching the image to fit your screen.
.br
\fBnone\fR  does no drawing and is intended for CPU benchmarking.
.br
Default is SOFT.
.TP
.B \-[no]window, \-[no]w
Run MESS in either full screen or a window. This is a fully\-featured window
mode where the window resizes as necessary to track what the system does.
And you can resize it yourself with your OS's standard window controls.
The default is OFF (\-nowindow).
.TP
.B \-[no]maximize, \-[no]max
Controls initial window size in windowed mode. If it is set on, the
window will initially be set to the maximum supported size when you
start MESS. If it is turned off, the window will start out at the
smallest supported size. This option only has an effect when the
\-window option is used. The default is ON (\-maximize).
.TP
.B \-[no]keepaspect, \-[no]ka
Forces the correct aspect ratio. This means when you're resizing the window
in windowed mode the actual system image will resize in discrete steps to
maintain the proper shape of the system graphics. If you turn this off you can
resize the window to anything you like and get funny squishing and stretching.
The same applies for full\-screen. Default is ON (\-keepaspect).
.TP
.B \-[no]unevenstretch, \-[no]ues
Allow non\-integer stretch factors. Video purists should stay far, far away
from this option, while everyone else will be happy to know that it lets you

Enables simulation of the "coin lockout" feature that is implemented
on a number of arcade game PCBs. It was up to the operator whether or not
the coin lockout outputs were actually connected to the coin
mechanisms. If this feature is enabled, then attempts to enter a coin
while the lockout is active will fail and will display a popup message
in the user interface. If this feature is disabled, the coin lockout
signal will be ignored. The default is ON (\-coin_lockout).
.TP
.B \-ctrlr \fIcontroller
Enables support for special controllers. Configuration files are
loaded from the ctrlrpath. They are in the same format as the .cfg
files that are saved, but only control configuration data is read
from the file. The default is NULL (no controller file).
.TP
.B \-[no]mouse
Controls whether or not MESS looks for a mouse controller to use. Note
that in many cases, lightguns are treated as mice by the operating
system, so you may need to enable this to enable lightgun support. When
this is enabled, you will not be able to use your mouse while running
MESS. If you want to get control of your computer back, you will need
to either pause MESS or quit. The default is OFF (\-nomouse).
.TP
.B \-[no]joystick, \-[no]joy
Controls whether or not MESS looks for joystick/gamepad controllers.
The default is ON (\-joystick).
.TP
.B \-[no]lightgun, \-[no]gun
Controls whether or not MESS makes use of lightgun controllers.
Note that most lightguns map to the mouse, so using \-lightgun and
\-mouse together may produce strange results. The default is OFF
(\-nolightgun).
.TP
.B \-[no]multikeyboard, \-[no]multikey
Determines whether MESS differentiates between multiple keyboards.
Some systems may report more than one keyboard; by default, the data
from all of these keyboards is combined so that it looks like a single
keyboard. Turning this option on will enable MESS to report keypresses
on different keyboards independently. The default is OFF
(\-nomultikeyboard).
.TP
.B \-[no]multimouse
Determines whether MESS differentiates between multiple mice. Some
systems may report more than one mouse device; by default, the data
from all of these mice is combined so that it looks like a single
mouse. Turning this option on will enable MESS to report mouse
movement and button presses on different mice independently. The
default is OFF (\-nomultimouse).
.TP
.B \-[no]steadykey, \-[no]steady
Some systems require two or more buttons to be pressed at exactly the
same time to make special moves. Due to limitations in the PC keyboard
hardware, it can be difficult or even impossible to accomplish that
using the standard keyboard handling. This option selects a different
handling that makes it easier to register simultaneous button presses,
but has the disadvantage of making controls less responsive. The
default is OFF (\-nosteadykey).
.TP
.B \-[no]ui_active
Enable MESS user interface on top of emulated keyboard (if present).
User interface may be toggled during execution by pressing the key
defined with \-ui_modekey.
Default is OFF (\-noui_active).
.TP
.B \-[no]offscreen_reload, \-[no]reload
Controls whether or not MESS treats a second button input from a
lightgun as a reload signal. In this case, MESS will report the gun's
position as (0,MAX) with the trigger held, which is equivalent to an
offscreen reload. This is only needed for systems that required you to
shoot offscreen to reload, and then only if your gun does not support
off screen reloads. The default is OFF (\-nooffscreen_reload).
.TP
.B \-joystick_map, \-joymap \fImap
Controls how joystick values map to digital joystick controls.
See /usr/share/doc/mame\-common/config.txt for full details on
joymap format.
.TP
.B \-joystick_deadzone, \-joy_deadzone, \-jdz \fIvalue
If you play with an analog joystick, the center can drift a little.
joystick_deadzone tells how far along an axis you must move before the
axis starts to change. This option expects a float in the range of
0.0 to 1.0. Where 0 is the center of the joystick and 1 is the outer
limit. The default is 0.3.
.TP
.B \-joystick_saturation, \-joy_saturation, \-jsat \fIvalue
If you play with an analog joystick, the ends can drift a little,
and may not match in the +/\- directions. joystick_saturation tells how
far along an axis movement change will be accepted before it reaches
the maximum range. This option expects a float in the range of 0.0 to
1.0, where 0 is the center of the joystick and 1 is the outer limit.
The default is 0.85.
.TP
.B \-[no]natural, \-[no]nat
Allows user to specify whether or not to use a natural keyboard.
This allows you to start your game or system in a 'native' mode, depending
on your region, allowing compatibility for non\-"QWERTY" style keyboards.
The default is OFF (\-nonatural).

.B \-joy_idx[0\-8] \fIjoystick
With these options you can assign a joystick to a

control for a particular system. For example, if you specify the option
\-paddle mouse, then any system that has a paddle control will automatically
