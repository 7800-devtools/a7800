Take some time to learn the framework with thse tutorials. But, if you need to get going FAST, try using the :doc:`quick 'n' dirty<all-the-things>` approach and your browser's / editors search function. It will also serve you well to look at all the `examples`_, which have recently gotten a bit of an overhaul to contain more relevant working examples.
