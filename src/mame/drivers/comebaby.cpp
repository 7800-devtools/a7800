TODO:
Nearly everything.

  There also appears to be a sequel which may be running on the same hardware, but which does not seem to have been released.
  Come On Baby - Ballympic Heroes!  (c) 2001

  Other games in this series include:
  Come On Baby 2 (c) 2002
  Come On Baby Jr (c) 2003 (which seems to be otherwise identical to Come On Baby but in a smaller cabinet)
  Come On Baby 2 Jr (c) 2003 (which seems to be otherwise identical to Come On Baby 2 but in a smaller cabinet)
  These may or may not be on identical hardware.

  This is a Korean PC based board running Windows.  The game runs fully from
  the hard disk making these things rather fragile and prone to damage.

  The donor PC looks like a standard Windows 98 setup.
  The only exceptions we see are that there's a game logo.sys/logo.bmp in the
  root directory to hide the Windows 98 startup screen, and a shortcut to
  the game in the startup programs.
  Also of interest, Windows 98 was installed from a setup folder on the HD.
  To me this hints that there may have been some expectation of the disk
  being plugged into random hardware.

  The game is pretty much a standard PC game running on a Windows 98 PC.
  It uses DirectSound and the Microsoft MCI interfaces and 3dfx Glide for video.
  The PC that the game was dumped from has Sound Blaster and Ensoniq drivers,
  but it works fine with some other sound configurations.
  The sound chip on the motherboard is not populated. There is a cheap Korean
  sound card "CS-6500P Made In Korea OJU CTN CO LTD." plugged into one of the
  slots containing a CRYSTAL CS4281-CM chip.
  The donor PC has a "3dfxvoodoo3" driver installation directory, but it works
  fine with a Voodoo4 4500.

  The game itself has some protection, it expects a file C:\\WINDOWS\win386p.swp of 84 bytes
  to have the hard disk volume serial number in ascii number (not hex) format at offset 4.

  The game appears to use parallel port (0x378,0x379) for I/O.
  The direct port access means it won't run on XP.
  For the controls, it writes a device select to 0x378, and reads the device value from 0x379.
  There is some other output, maybe lights?

   --------------------------------------------

  Easy enough to fix a broken game if you have the controls to plug into it.
