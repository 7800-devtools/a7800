		"values, so things like a < 0 won't work as expected. Second, the logical operators && and || do "
		"not have short-circuit properties -- both halves are always evaluated. Finally, the new memory "
		"operators work like this: b@<addr> refers to the byte read from <addr>. Similarly, w@ refers to "
		"a word in memory, d@ refers to a dword in memory, and q@ refers to a qword in memory. The memory "
		"operators can be used as both lvalues and rvalues, so you can write b@100 = ff to store a byte "
		"in memory. By default these operators read from the program memory space, but you can override "
		"that by prefixing them with a 'd' or an 'i'. So dw@300 refers to data memory word at address "
		"300 and id@400 refers to an I/O memory dword at address 400.\n"
