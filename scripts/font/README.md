# Noto fonts

Noto's goal is to provide a beautiful reading experience for everyone and for all languages. With visual harmony when multiple languages share a page. With multiple styles and weights. **_Freely available to all._**

Currently, Noto covers all major languages of the world and many others, including European, African, Middle Eastern, Indic, South and Southeast Asian, Central Asian, American, and East Asian languages. Several minority and historical languages are also supported.

Support for Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean was first added in July 2014.

You can preview and download the Noto fonts at http://www.google.com/get/noto

Noto fonts are open source. All fonts are published under the [SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL).  (Prior to September 29, 2015, Noto fonts other than CJK were published under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).)

Use unhinted fonts for Android and Mac (Android and Mac ignore hinting information embedded in fonts). Use hinted fonts for other platforms.

## Special Note on Droid Fonts

The Droid fonts are superseded by Noto. Noto began as Droid, and since renaming all updates are made to the Noto fonts. 
Today Noto gives better support to all languages covered by Droid fonts, with more characters and fewer bugs, and covers many more languages. 
Both Android and ChromeOS have switched to Noto, and we strongly recommend everyone to replace Droid with Noto.

Similarly, the Droid Sans Fallback font is superseded by Noto Sans CJK, available from [noto-cjk](https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-cjk).

Have fun!
