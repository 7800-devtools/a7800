/*
    The Laser Battle/Lazarian sound board has a SN76477 CSG, two TMS3615
    tone synthesisers, and a TDA1010 power amplifier.  It receives
    commands from the game board over a 16-bit unidirectional data bus.
    The CPU cannot write all sixteen lines atomically, it write to lines
    1-8 as one group and 9-16 as another group.

    The game board makes the the audio output from the first S2636 PVI
    (5E) available on a pin at the sound board interface connector, but
    it isn't routed anywhere, so you won't hear it.

    The TMS3615 at 05 is clocked at 250kHz (4MHz crystal oscillator
    divided by 16), and its divide-by-two output is used to clock the
    TMS3615 at 04.  This gives a base 16' note of C3.  The combined 8'
    or 16' outputs are selectable by jumper, allowing board to be
    switched between two octaves.  There's no indication of which octave
    would have been selected in the Lazarian manual.

    There's a filter network between the TMS3615 outputs and the power
    amplifier with several parameters controllable from the game board.

    The audio output of the SN76477 isn't actually used.  Rather the
    signal from before the output amplifier is taken and used to gate
    distortion elements in the analog filter network.

    When bit 13 is high, no SLF control resistor is connected to the
    CSG.  When bit 13 is low, bits 11 and 12 select between 27k, 22k and
    12k.

    When bit 13 is high, the clock input of a latch driving eight of
    TMS3615 key inputs will be driven low, depending on bits 11 and 12.
    These latches are positive edge triggered, and you have to beware of
    glitches, so the safe way to set key inputs is:
    * Ensure bit 13 is low
    * Write desired key data pattern to CSOUND1
    * Write CSOUND2 setting bits 11 and 12 to select keys to set
    * Write CSOUND2 setting bit 13 high
    * Write CSOUND2 setting bit 13 low
    * Write CSOUND2 setting bits 11 and 12 to select SLF resistor

    Note that the SLF resistor will necessarily thrash around during the
    process of setting key data.  It's a side-effect of the way control
    lines are overloaded.

    The SN76477 control bits are defined as follows:

    +-----+---------------------------------------------------------+
    | Bit | Function                                                |

    |  3  | Noise filter/VCO resistor select C                      |
    |  4  | AB SOUND (connected to System Inhibit input)            |
    |  5  | VCO/NOISE (connected to Mixer Select B input)           |

    |  7  | FILT (gates 10nF capacitor across distortion elements)  |
    |  8  | A (controls a distortion element in filter network)     |

    The Cat and Mouse sound board has a 6802 processor with three ROMs,
    a 6821 PIA, two AY-3-8910 PSGs, and some other logic and analog
    circuitry.  Unfortunately we lack a schematic, so all knowledge of
    this board is based on tracing the sound program, examining PCB
    photos and cross-referencing with the schematic for the 1B11142
    schematic.

    The 6821 PIA is mapped at addresses $005C..$005F.  The known PIA
    signal assignments are as follows:

    +------+-----------------------+

    The program makes use of I/O port A on the first PSG as outputs.  At
    a guess, it could have the same function as it does on other
    Zaccaria sound boards.

    The first PSG receives commands from the game board in the low five
    bits of port B.  Commands are processed on receiving an NMI.  The
    sound program always masks out the high three bits of the value so
    they could be connected to anything on the board.

    The I/O ports on the second PSG don't appear to be used at all.

    The game board sends commands to the sound board over a 16-bit
    unidirectional data bus.  The CPU cannot write all sixteen lines
    atomically, it write to lines 1-8 as one group and 9-16 as another
    group.  However only seven lines are actually connected to the sound
    board:

    Bit 9 is used to select the sprite ROM bank.  There's a wire visible
    on the component side of the PCB connecting it to the high address
    bit (A11) of the sprite ROM at 14L.

    There could well be other connections on the sound board - these are
    just what can be deduced by tracing the sound program.

    The game board makes the the audio output from the first S2636 PVI
    (5E) available on a pin at the sound board interface connector, but
    it isn't routed anywhere.
