Overview:
    TMS9901 is a support chip for TMS9900.  It handles interrupts, provides
    several I/O pins, and a timer (a.k.a. clock: it is merely a register which
    decrements regularly and can generate an interrupt when it reaches 0).

    It communicates with the TMS9900 with the CRU bus, and with the rest of the
    world with a number of parallel I/O pins.

    I/O and timer functions should work with any other 990/99xx/99xxx CPU.
    On the other hand, interrupt handling was primarily designed for tms9900
    and 99000 based systems: other CPUs can support interrupts, but not the 16
    distinct interrupt vectors.

Pins:
    Vcc, Vss: power supply
    Phi*: system clock (connected to TMS9900 Phi3* or TMS9980 CLKOUT*)
    RST1*: reset input
    CRUIN, CRUOUT, CRUCLK, CE*, S0-S4: CRU bus (CPU interface)
    INTREQ*, IC0-IC3: interrupt bus (CPU interface)
    INT*1-INT*6: used as interrupt/input pins.
    P0-P6: used as input/output pins.
    INT*7/P15-INT*15/P7: used as either interrupt/input or input/output pins.
      Note that a pin cannot be used simultaneously as output and as interrupt.
      (This is mostly obvious, but it implies that you cannot trigger an
      interrupt by setting the output state of a pin, which is not SO obvious.)

Interrupt handling:
    After each clock cycle, TMS9901 latches the state of INT1*-INT15* (except
    pins which are set as output pins).  If the clock is enabled, it replaces
    INT3* with an internal timer interrupt flag.  Then it inverts the value and
    performs a bit-wise AND with the interrupt mask.

    If there are some unmasked interrupt bits, INTREQ* is asserted and the code
    of the lowest active interrupt is placed on IC0-IC3.  If these pins are
    duly connected to the tms9900 INTREQ* and IC0-IC3 pins, the result is that
    asserting an INTn* on tms9901 will cause a level-n interrupt request on the
    tms9900, provided that this interrupt pin is not masked in tms9901, and
    that no unmasked higher-priority (i.e. lower-level) interrupt pin is set.

    This interrupt request lasts for as long as the interrupt pin and the
    relevant bit in the interrupt mask are set (level-triggered interrupts).
    (The request may be shadowed by a higher-priority interrupt request, but
    it will resume when the higher-priority request ends.)

    TIMER interrupts are kind of an exception, since they are not associated
    with an external interrupt pin.  I think there is an internal timer
    interrupt flag that is set when the decrementer reaches 0, and is cleared
    by a write to the 9901 int*3 enable bit ("SBO 3" in interrupt mode).

TODO:
    * Emulate the RST1* input.  Note that RST1* active (low) makes INTREQ*
      inactive (high) with IC0-IC3 = 0.
    * the clock read register is updated every time the timer decrements when
      the TMS9901 is not in clock mode.  This probably implies that if the
      clock mode is cleared and re-asserted immediately, the tms9901 may fail
      to update the clock read register: this is not emulated.
    * The clock mode is entered when a 1 is written to the control bit.  It is
      exited when a 0 is written to the control bit or the a tms9901 select bit
      greater than 15 is accessed.  According to the data sheet, "when CE* is
      inactive (HIGH), the PSI is not disabled from seeing the select lines.
      As the CPU is accessing memory, A10-A14 could very easily have a value of
      15 or greater" (this is assuming that S0-S4 are connected to A10-A14,
      which makes sense with most tms9900 family members).  There is no way
      this "feature" (I would call it a hardware bug) can be emulated
      efficiently, as we would need to watch every memory access.

MZ: According to the description in
       A. Osborne, G. Kane: Osborne 16-bit microprocessor handbook
       page 3-81
    the 9901 only temporarily leaves the timer mode as long as S0 is set to 1.
    In the meantime the timer function continues but cannot be queried. This
    makes it possible to continue using the chip as a timer while working with
    its I/O pins. Thus I believe the above TODO concering the exit of the timer
    mode is not applicable.
    The problem is that the original 9901 specification is not clear about this.

MZ: Turned to class (January 2012)

TODO: Tests on a real machine
- Set an interrupt input (e.g. keyboard for Geneve), trigger RST2*, check whether
  interrupt mask has been reset
- Check whether the clock_read_register is updated whenever clock mode is exited
  (in particular when S0=1, i.e. A10=1 -> addresses xxxx xxxx xx1x xxxx
  requires to write a program that fits into 32 bytes; workspace elsewhere)
