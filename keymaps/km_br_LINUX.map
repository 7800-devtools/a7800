# MAME/MESS keymap for Brazilian QWERTY 107-keys keyboard (Linux)
#
# The 107-keys Brazilian keyboard has an extra key used to type "/".
# Since I don't own such a keyboard, I can't write a proper definition.
# However, it should be placed in the 4th row, after ITEM_ID_SLASH.
#
# SDL can tell the difference between the two COMPOSE keys but assigns them the same label
# thus both OPENBRACE and QUOTE appear like "´ ~" in the user interface.
# The following definitions are therefore correct.
#
# Row 1
#
