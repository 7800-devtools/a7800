a7800.c

Driver file to handle emulation of the Atari 7800.

Dan Boris

2002/05/13 kubecj
        -added more banks for bankswitching
        -added PAL machine description
        -changed clock to be precise
        -improved cart emulation (in machine/).

2012/10/25 Robert Tuccitto 
        -NTSC Color Generator utilized for
         color palette with hue shift/start
         based on observation of several
         systems across multiple displays.

2012/11/09 Robert Tuccitto
        -Fixed 3 degree hue begin point
         miscalculation of color palette.

2012/12/05 Robert Tuccitto  
        -Implemented proper IRE and phase
         value to the palette.

2012/12/14 Robert Tuccitto  
        -Adjusted colorburst/tint/hue of entire
         palette to closer reflect default hardware 
         configuration setting of ~180 degrees.  Palette 
         settings now correspond documented and 
         calculated settings as follows:
                *Contrast = 0.0526 --> 0.05
                *Brightness = 0.0 --> 0.00
                *Color = 0.2162 --> 0.22
                *Phase = 25.714 --> 25.7
                *Colorburst/Hue = 180 degrees

2013/02/27 Robert Tuccitto 
        -Palette rebuild due to misaligned data
         references.
        -Corrected PAL color sequence order.

2013/03/19 Robert Tuccitto
        -Stripped palette to raw video output values 
         removing YIQ/YUV infer data.

2013/04/02 Robert Tuccitto  
        -Corrected rotation values and errors including 
         duplicate entries for palette.

2013/04/07 Robert Tuccitto  
        -Address map locations for the XBOARD added.

2013/05/01 Robert Tuccitto
        -Red and Blue miscalculated proportions fixed.

2013/08/04 Robert Tuccitto
        -Green miscalculated proportions fixed.

2013/08/13 Robert Tuccitto
        -Normalized contrast and brightness, providing a 
         standardize grayscale and adjusted color values.

2013/09/02 Robert Tuccitto
        -Stored data for 26.7 & 27.7 phase shifts with
         corrections and label for 25.7 values. Made 26.7
         default. Phase shifting falls outside the
         realm of video controls and hope to implement a
         selectable toggle hardware option similar to Donkey 
         Kong TKG02/TKG04.

2013/09/19 Robert Tuccitto
        -Cleanup of Address Maps, high score maps added.

2013/10/16 Robert Tuccitto  
        -Added Phase Shifts 24.7, 25.2, 26.2, 27.2. Phase 
         Shifts 24.7 through 27.7 degrees with 0.5 degree
         increments documented. 
        -Phase Shift 26.2 degrees made active.
        -Fixed typo under 26.7 7$.

2013/10/27 Robert Tuccitto
        -Modernized screen parameters for NTSC & PAL.

2013/11/03 Robert Tuccitto
        -Fixed correctly typo under 26.7 7$.

2013/11/23 Robert Tuccitto
        -Added NTSC Palette Notes.

2014/01/02 Robert Tuccitto
        -Corrected joystick buttons assignment & minor
         palette notes cleanup.

2014/01/09 Robert Tuccitto  
        -Positional description for difficulty switches 
         added.

2014/02/15 Robert Tuccitto  
        -Added more details and clarification regarding 
         the potentiometer.

2014/03/25 Mike Saarna
        -Fixed Riot Timer.

2014/04/04 Mike Saarna  
        -Fix to controller button RIOT behavior.

2014/05/06 Mike Saarna/Robert Tuccitto 
        -Brought initial Maria cycle counts inline from 
         measurements taken with logic analyzer and tests.

2014/08/25 Fabio Priuli
        -Converted carts to be slot devices and cleaned up 
         the driver (removed the pokey, cleaned up rom 
    	 regions, etc.)

2017/07/14 Mike Saarna/Robert Tuccito   
        -Converted to slotted controls and added support 
         for proline joysticks, vcs joysticks, paddles,
         lightguns, keypads, driving wheels, cx22 trakballs, 
         amiga mice, st mice/cx80. 

2020/06/10 Mike Saarna/Robert Tuccitto 
        -Implementation of XM control registers updated.
        -SALLY (CPU) and MARIA (Graphics chip) performance adjustments.
        -Additional display options and enhancements.
        -Audio indication of no ROM loaded silenced.
        -Corrected ST and Amiga mouse button behavior.
        -7800 bios files made optional (with warning when absent).
        -Minor POKEY audio emulation improvements.

2022/03/31 Mike Saarna/Robert Tuccitto
        -Graphical register updates made mid-scanline are now displayed mid-scanline.
        -Bankset bankswitching support added.
        -POKEY emulation quality improvements.
        -Improved lightgun emulation accuracy.
        -a7800dev and a7800pdev machine targets added, which display DMA usage per-scanline.
        -Balanced palette brightness and saturation.
        -POKEY@800 added for non-banked, supergame, and bankset formats.

2022/05/02 Mike Saarna
        -POKEY emulation updated for better two-tone mode accuracy
        -Fix for cart format supergame+ram+pokey@800 crash

2022/06/26 Mike Saarna
        -POKEY poly9 sequence correction.
        -POKEY init state corrected to match real hardware.

2023/08/23 Robert Tuccitto
        -Palettes updated:
                *Fixed luma value correlation to hue begin point.
                *Improved duplication of hue behaviors according to temperature.
                *Fine adjustment to midrange hues.
                *Tweaked overall brightness balancing.

2023/10/10 Robert Tuccitto
        -Luminance ramp properly calibrated per CPS 7800 Diagnostic Test
         Cartridge for cool, warm, and hot palettes. Ensures all
         intended graphic details, difference in shading, and color
         distinction is visible.

Atari 7800 Palette Excerpts 
Source: http://7800.8bitdev.org/index.php/Atari_7800_Color_Documentation

NTSC and PAL Palettes
Atari 7800 color values are split into 2 parts - the upper 4 bits control 
the hue of the color, and the lower 4 bits control the brightness of the 
color. Atari 7800 color values are often represented in hexadecimal 
notation, since each digit in a single byte $XX hex number represents 
4 bits.

The 7800 uses very similar palettes for NTSC and PAL consoles, with some 
minor differences with the hue at any one register.

Technical Overview of Color Generation
The color system in the 7800 is designed to efficiently generate color 
signals that are PAL or NTSC ready, with very little silicon and support 
circuitry. To better understand 7800 colors, it helps to have a general 
understanding of NTSC and PAL color encoding.

Both NTSC and PAL TV standards have a short colorburst signal near the 
beginning of each scanline. The colorburst serves 2 purposes. Its presence 
signals to the TV that the scanline will contain color information, but it 
also serves as a phase reference. If the same frequency is later detected 
by the TV during the display of a pixel, the TV will compare the 
frequency's phase relative to the original colorburst, and use the result 
as an index to a hue in the YIQ colorspace(NTSC) or YUV colorspace(PAL).

From a signal perspective, the top 4 bits of any color register actually 
determines the amount of phase-shift applied to the color frequency, and 
the bottom 4 bits determines the voltage level of the pixel.

The 7800 color system uses a uniform level of saturation for all of its 
color values, except for color values from $00 to $0F, which are displayed 
without any saturation. This allows for the display of black, shades of 
grey, and white.

Consistency Issues
There are a number of factors that result in inconsistency between the 
palettes of 7800 consoles.
	
Each 7800 console has a tunable resistor inside, which is used to modify
the color signal frequency period. On any given console this resistor may 
be adjusted a number of different ways, with at least 2 published historic 
standards in play - one with hues ~25.7 degrees apart, and another with 
hues ~26.7 degrees apart.
	
As a 7800 console warms up, so do the components that produce the color 
signal frequency period, while the colorburst frequency remains constant, 
so the distance between the various hues in the palette stretch out. When 
cold, the console's hue values have ~24.7 degrees of separation, and as
the console warms up, up to ~27.7 degrees of separation can be seen between 
the hues. The separation is cumulative, and so is more pronounced with 
higher hue values; the $Ex hue can shift from being green through 
yellow/brown, and $Fx can shift from an initial greenish-yellow/brown 
through to a reddish yellow/brown. The majority of this shifting will 
happen in the first 20 minutes of console operation, though some additional 
shifting can be seen hours later.
	
The NTSC and PAL standards don't consistently display the same colors from 
TV to TV, and almost all TVs allow the viewer to tune colors to their 
liking.

The largest factor in these consistency issues is typically the warm-up
issue. Latter hues shift more than the earlier ones.

Color Artifacting
320 pixel modes on the 7800 are prone to artifacting colors. The 7800 pixel 
clock operates at twice the colorburst frequency, so from the TV's 
perspective, any alternating pattern of light and dark 320 mode pixels is 
indistinguishable from color information. If the light pixels are on even 
positions, one color is produced, and if dark pixels are on even positions, 
another color is produced.

A second set of artifact colors can be produced by alternating pairs of 
light pixels with pairs of dark pixels. This second set of artifact colors 
will be less intense, and striped in luminance.

The specific artifact colors produced can vary from console to console, 
depending on hardware modifications, and likely varying between MARIA 
revisions. Its also worth mentioning that if a console has been video
modified to produce s-video output, it won't be able to display artifact 
colors, since the pixel luminance signal will no longer be mixed with the 
chroma signal. Similarly, if you turn off the colorburst signal using 
the CTRL register, artifacting will be eliminated, along with the rest of 
the non-artifact colors.
