/* TMS51xx and TMS52xx ROM Tables */

/* The following table is assumed to be for TMS5100
 *
 * US Patent 4209836
 *           4331836
 *           4304964
 *           4234761
 *           4189779
 *           4449233
 *
 * All patents give interpolation coefficients
 *  { 1, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 2, 2 }
 *  This sequence will not calculate the published
 *  fractions:
 * 1 8 0.125
 * 2 8 0.234
 * 3 8 0.330
 * 4 4 0.498
 * 5 4 0.623
 * 6 2 0.717
 * 7 2 0.859
 * 0 1 1.000
 * (remember, 1 is the FIRST entry!)
 *
 * Instead,  { 1, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 2 }
 * will calculate those coefficients.
 * Howeever, after simulating the actual circuit from the patent in pspice,
 * the { 1, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 2, 2 } pattern is revealed as the correct one.
 * Since the real chip uses shifters and not true division to achieve those
 * factors, they have been replaced by the shifting coefficients:
 * { 0, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1 }

	/* quick note on derivative analysis:
	Judging by all the TI chips I (Lord Nightmare) have done this test on,
	the first derivative between successive values of the LPC tables should
	follow a roughly triangular or sine shaped curve, the second derivative
	should start at a value, increase slightly, then decrease smoothly and
	become negative right around where the LPC curve passes 0, finally
	increase slightly right near the end. If it doesn't do this, there is
	probably a wrong value in there somewhere. The pitch and energy tables
	follow similar patterns but aren't the same since they never cross 0.
	The chirp table doesn't follow this pattern at all.

   The coefficients are exactly the same as the TMS5200.
   The coefficients also come from US Patents 4,403,965, 4,631,748 and
   4,946,391 (with one typo in all 3 patents: K9(3) is 0x3E0, not 0x3ED).

   The Mitsubishi M58817 also seems to work best with these coefficients, so
   it is possible the engineers of that chip copied them from the TI patents.
   ***TODO: there are 2 versions of this chip, and the interpolation
      behavior between the two differs slightly:
   * TMC0280NLP // CD2801 with datecodes around 1980 has the same
     interpolation inhibit behavior as 5100/TMC0281 on unvoiced->silent
     transition.
   * CD2801A-NL with datecodes around 1982 have the 'alternate behavior',
     which seems to be a somewhat crude workaround for a bug where when
     an unvoiced frame follows a silent one (which in turn followed a
     voiced frame), the k5-k10 parameters are not zeroed as they should be,
     producing a loud noise.
     This bug is fixed correctly on the tms52xx chips.

/* TMS5200/CD2501E
 (1979-1983 era)
The TMS5200NL was decapped and imaged by digshadow in March, 2013.
It is equivalent to the CD2501E (internally: "TMC0285") chip used
 on the TI 99/4(A) speech module.
The LPC table is verified to match the decap.
 (It was previously dumped with PROMOUT which matches as well)
The chirp table is verified to match the decap. (sum = 0x3da)
Note that the K coefficients are VERY different from the coefficients given
 in the US 4,335,277 patent, which may have been for some sort of prototype or
 otherwise intentionally scrambled. The energy and pitch tables, however, are
 identical to that patent.
Also note, that the K coefficients are identical to the coefficients from the
 CD2801 (which itself is almost identical to the CD2802).
NOTE FROM DECAP: immediately to the left of each of the K1,2,3,4,5,and 6
 coefficients in the LPC rom are extra columns containing the constants
 -510, -502, 313, 318, or in hex 0x202, 0x20A, 0x139, 0x13E.
 Those EXACT constants DO appear (rather nonsensically) on the lpc table in US
 patent 4,335,277. They are likely related to the multiplicative interpolator
 described in us patent 4,419,540; whether the 5200/2501E and the 5220 or 5220C
 actually implement this interpolator or not is unclear. This interpolator
 seems intended for chips with variable frame rate, so if it exists at all,
 it may only exist on the TMS/TSP5220C and CD2501ECD.
