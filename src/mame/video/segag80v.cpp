/*

    Vector system is clocked by a 15-phase clock.

    The counter is a LS161 4-bit binary counter at U51, and its output
    goes to a LS154 1-of-16 decoder at U50.

    Each phase various things happen. The phases are:

     0 -> (sheet 7/7) clocks CD7 in

     1 -> (sheet 5/7) loads CD0-7 into counters at U15/U16
          (sheet 6/7) clear LS175 flip flops at U35, U36, U37, U38

     2 -> (sheet 5/7) loads CD0-3 into counter at U17

     3 -> (sheet 5/7) loads CD0-7 into counters at U18/U19

     4 -> (sheet 5/7) loads CD0-3 into counter at U20

     5 ->

     6 ->

     7 -> (sheet 6/7) at end, latches CD0-7 into LS374 tri-state flip flop at U55 (SYM angle)

     8 -> (sheet 6/7) at end, latches CD0-1 into LS74 flip flops at U26 (upper SYM angle)

     9 -> (sheet 4/7) at end, latches CD0-7 into 25LS14 multiplier X input at U8 (scale)

    10 -> (sheet 4/7) at end, latches CD0-CD7 into LS374 tri-state flip flop at U2 (attributes)
          (sheet 7/7) at end, latches CD7 into U52 (low), which sets the preload value
            for the LS161 at U51 to be either 0 (if CD7==1) or 10 (if CD7==0)

    11 -> (sheet 4/7) at end, starts multiply circuit

    12 -> (sheet 6/7) at end, latches CD0-7 into LS374 tri-state flip flop at U56 (VEC angle)

    13 -> (sheet 6/7) at end, latches output from 2708 PROM into tri-state flip flop at U48
          (sheet 6/7) at end, latches bit $200 of angle into D/UX output

    14 -> (sheet 6/7) at end, latches output from 2708 PROM into tri-state flip flop at U49
          (sheet 6/7) at end, latches bit $200 of angle into D/UY output
          (sheet 7/7) signals /PE on the LS161 at U51, loading the new value for the state clock
          (sheet 7/7) sets up the DRAW signal to clock on the next VCL edge

    15 ->



    PROM inputs:
        A0 = GND
        A1-A8 = sum of VEC angle and SYM angle (low 8 bits)
        A9 = sum of bit 8 of VEC angle and SYM angle, plus 1 for phase 13
