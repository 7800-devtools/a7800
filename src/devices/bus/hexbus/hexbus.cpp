    =========== Hexbus peripheral bus ===========

    The Hexbus is a 4-bit peripheral bus with master/slave coordination. Bytes
    are written over the bus in two passes. Hexbus was the designated standard
    peripheral bus for TI computers before TI left the home computer market.

    The Hexbus was also named IPB = Intelligent Peripheral Bus [1]

    Existing devices are floppy drive, RS232 serial adapter, and
    a "Wafertape" drive (kind of tape streamer)

    Hexbus connector (console)
    +---+---+---+---+
    | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |      4 = L;    3 = BAV*; 2 = ADB1; 1 = ADB0
    +---+---+---+---+
    | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 |      8 = ADB3; 7 = ADB2; 6 = nc;   5 = HSK*
    +---+---+---+---+

    ADBx = Hexbus data bit X (x=0..3)
    HSK* = Handshake
    BAV* = Bus available (0=yes)

    Theory of operation
    -------------------
    The bus connects all devices in a daisy chain. The lines are inactive high
    and pulled down by any device that sets them to 0.

    HSK* is a synchronization line for transmitting single bytes.
    BAV* is a synchronization line for complete request-response pairs

    Before a byte can be sent, the sender must check the BAV* line. When it is
    inactive (1), it pulls it down, and then starts transmitting. The line
    is raised again when the response has been fully received.

    For transmitting a byte, the HSK* line must first be pulled down by the
    sender. Then, the lower nibble is transmitted first, and the sender
    releases the HSK* line. Every receiver that has completely received the
    nibble and is ready for the next one releases the HSK* line. The sender
    must check the HSK* line until it goes high again (which means that the
    slowest receiver has got the nibble). This is repeated for the high nibble.

    When the BAV* signal is asserted (0), the HSK* line must not be high for
    more than 20 ms, or a bus timeout occurs.

    The device address is transmitted as part of the request header. All
    devices with a non-matching device code must ignore the rest of the
    message until BAV* goes inactive (1) again.

    If there is no matching device, HSK* will remain 1 after the end of the
    master's request, and after 20ms, a timeout will occur. Declaring a timeout
    is a matter of the devices, not of the bus.

    Message format

    Device codes
    ------------

    0       - all devices (but none will respond, forcing a timeout)
    1-8     - Tape mass storage
    10-17   - Printer / plotter
    20-27   - RS-232 interface
    30-37   - TV interface (color)
    40-47   - TV interface (B/W)
    50-57   - Centronics interface
    60-67   - Calculator in slave mode
    70-77   - Modem
    80-87   - GPIB interface (?)
    90-97   - Bar code reader
    100-107 - Floppy disk drive

    Usage in MAME
    -------------

    mame <driver> -hexbus <device>

    Usually the device offers an own hexbus socket, so we can chain devices:

    mame <driver> -hexbus <device1> -hexbus:<device1>:hexbus <device2> ...

    The direction towards the console is named "inbound" in the implementation,
    while the direction towards the end of the chain is named "outbound".

    Implementation
    --------------

    All lines (ADB0-3, HSK*, BAV*) are pull-down outputs with open collectors,
    and at the same time also inputs.

    The challenge, compared to other daisy-chained buses, is that the Hexbus
    is nondirectional. Writing on the bus is sensed by all devices in either
    direction. Also, reading from the bus is the product of all active output
    buffers. With no active device, the bus lines are pulled high.

    Every Hexbus device has an interface "device_hexbus_interface" which
    allows it to plug into a preceding Hexbus socket.

    Since the signal propagation is the same for all devices, there is a
    parent class "hexbus_chained_device" that calculates the current levels
    for all bus lines by fetching all values from the attached devices, ANDing
    them, and propagating them again. This must be done in both directions.

    Reading is simpler, because we assume that changes can only be done by
    writing to the bus.

    The "hexbus_chained_device" implements the "device_hexbus_interface"
    and holds references to up to two Hexbus instances, one for each direction.
    The computer console will not offer an inbound Hexbus connection, only
    an outbound one, and possibly there is some device that must be connected
    at the end, without further outbound connections.

    By default, instances of "hexbus_chained_device" own an outbound
    hexbus slot as a subdevice; this may be overwritten by subclasses.
