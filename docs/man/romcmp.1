.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBromcmp\fP is a tool developed to detect the most common errors that
can occur when dumping ROMS, for example stuck bits and address line errors.
.PP
It can check the ROMs in ZIP files or subdirectories; it can also be used
to compare two ROM sets, by giving it two files or subdirectories
as parameters. It will determine which ROMS are identical and which are
the closest matches.  This is useful when figuring out if a newly dumped
ROM set is a clone of another ROM set.

Enables a slower, more comprehensive comparison.

.\" EXAMPLES chapter
.SH EXAMPLES
.B romcmp jumpkids.zip
will output the following:

  11 files
  23.3c			FIXED BITS (xxxxxx1x)
  23.3c		  	FIRST AND SECOND HALF IDENTICAL
      
This tells us that the 23.3C ROM in Jump Kids is bad, and incidentally,
it causes the missing sound in that game.
