Harmony / Melody cart for the A2600

The Harmony cart is a 'modern' A2600 cartridge, used for homebrew etc. It has
an SD slot and can be connected to a PC, roms can be transferred to it with
software on the PC side.  It uses an ARM7TDMI-S LPC2103 @ 70 Mhz to emulate
the mapper behavior of other cartridges.  It has an SD card slot for storing
game data.

The Melody version of the cartridge has been used for several recent A2600
commercial releases as well as some reproductions due to it's ability to be
programmed as any other cartridge type.  This lacks the SD slot?

The 'DPC+' games by SpiceWare run on a Harmony / Melody cart, DPC+ seems to
be a virtual 'software mapper' programmed on the ARM rather than a real mapper.


There is also a 'Harmony Encore' cartridge which adds support for some of the
games the original couldn't handle due to them having larger ROMs and more
complex banking schemes (Stella's Stocking etc.)

DPC+ notes
----------

Some info on the Harmony / Melody when configured as DPC+ hardware can be found on Darrell Spice Jr's guides:
